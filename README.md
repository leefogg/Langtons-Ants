# Simple Langton's Ant Example
The purpose of this project was to create a working example of Chris Langton's ants behaviour as described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant) for educational purposes.
As this project in intended for education purposes, the code has been designed to be as simple and easy to follow as possible.
This project was created in a 30-minuite challenge to myself.
